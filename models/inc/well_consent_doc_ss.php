	<h2>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH</h2>
	<p>The WELL for Life Initiative aims to identify factors that contribute to wellbeing and health. The WELL for Life Initiative has been created by the Stanford Prevention Research Center in the Stanford University School of Medicine.</p> 
	<p>You are being invited to enter the WELL for Life Registry, which is gathering information on people’s health and wellbeing. As a WELL for Life Registry participant you will be invited to take part in future WELL for Life Projects. Our goal is to enroll 10,000 people living in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the future, we hope to enroll participants from all across the US.</p>
	<p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide to end your participation in this study, you should notify John Ioannidis at (650) 725-5465 or Sandra Winter at 650-723-8513.</p>

	<h2>PROGRAM ACTIVITIES</h2> 
	<p>The WELL for Life Registry consists of a number of online surveys. The first survey takes about 20-30 minutes and asks for your contact details and about your basic demographics (e.g., age, gender, language), lifestyle habits and behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, tobacco use), and your community. Later surveys will ask similar questions about your lifestyle habits, health, and wellness. You also may be asked to provide a photograph, voice or video recording as a measure of wellbeing. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions.</p>
	<p>We will test different strategies to make participation in the WELL for Life Registry engaging. For example, we may “gamify” the survey, provide you with varying types of feedback, change the order in which you answer the surveys or the messages and reminders that we send you, and provide you with informational content.</p>
	<p>You may be asked if you would be interested in being interviewed about your experience as a WELL for Life participant. If you do NOT wish to be contacted about being interviewed, please indicate that on the first survey.</p>
	<p>You may also be asked if you would be interested in being contacted about participating in other non-WELL related studies in the future.  If you do NOT wish to be contacted, please indicate that on the first survey.</p>

	<p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care. You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled.</p>
